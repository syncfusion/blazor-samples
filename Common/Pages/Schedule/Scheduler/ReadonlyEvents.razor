<ActionDescription>
<p>
    This demo showcases how to make specific events on the Scheduler display in a read-only mode. Read-only events can be simply viewed and are prevented from undergoing any edit actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this demo, events that occurred in the past hours from the current time are made read-only, and CRUD actions are prevented on them. This is achieved by setting <code>true</code> to the <code>IsReadonly</code> field of past events. By doing so, the <code>aria-readonly</code> attribute is added to the event element, differentiating it from other normal events.
