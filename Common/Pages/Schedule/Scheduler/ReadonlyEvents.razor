<SampleDescription>
    <p>This demo showcases how to make specific events on the Scheduler to be displayed in a read-only mode. The read-only events can be simply viewed and prevented from undergoing any edit actions.</p>
</SampleDescription>
<ActionDescription>
    <p>In this demo, the events that occurred on the past hours from the current time are made as read-only and the CRUD actions have been prevented on it. This has been done by setting <code>true</code> to the <code>IsReadonly</code> field of past events. By doing so, the <code>aria-readonly</code> attribute gets added to the event element and differentiates it from the other normal events.  </p>
