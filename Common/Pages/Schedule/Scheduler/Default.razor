    <p>
        The Scheduler aka event calendar facilitates almost all the calendar features, thus allowing users to manage their time efficiently. It features easy resource scheduling, appointments rescheduling through
        editor pop-ups, drag and drop, and a resizing action. It includes wide variety of view modes with unique configuration options for each view. The available view modes are listed below, out of which the <code>Week</code> view is set as active.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day</li>
        <li>Week</li>
        <li>Work Week</li>
        <li>Month</li>
        <li>Agenda</li>
        <li>Month Agenda</li>
        <li>Timeline Day</li>
        <li>Timeline Week</li>
        <li>Timeline Work Week</li>
        <li>Timeline Month</li>
        <li>Timeline Year</li>
        <li>Year</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To navigate between views and dates, the navigation options are available at the Scheduler header bar and the active view option is highlighted by default. The date range of the active view will also be displayed in the header bar, clicking on which will open a calendar popup for ease of desired date selection. </p>

                    <li>Tap holding on events, opens a small popup at the top holding the options to edit or delete and also displays the selected event's subject. As a continuation of this action, if user keeps on single tapping on other events, it will allow the multiple event selection. Also, the previous popup remains in opened state, showing the count of the number of events selected. </li>
                    <li>Tap hold the event and try moving it over the Scheduler to enable drag and drop action. </li>
